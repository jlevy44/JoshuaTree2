# use -show_parsed option to only report what has been parsed
#
# If your values are quoted, contain thousands-separators, or have other
# cruft, use -remove_cell_rx to define a regular expression of chararacters
# that should be removed from each field.
#
# The value of -remove_cell_rx will be turned into a character class which will
# be removed. For example, if -remove_cell_rx abc then the regular expression will be
# [abc] and the substitutution will be s/[abc]//g
#
# If you have thousands-separator , then do not use the same string as a delimiter!]

# cat parse-example-1.txt | ../bin/parse-table -field_delim \s -remove_cell_rx '",()'
