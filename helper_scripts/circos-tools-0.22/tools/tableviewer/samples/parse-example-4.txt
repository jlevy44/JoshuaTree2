# use -show_parsed option to only report what has been parsed

# When the delimiter is white space (e.g. space, tab) and your input data is from
# a source that uses white space to format output, you should use -field_delim_collapse to 
# collapse adjacent spaces
#
# Use \s to mean any whitespace (e.g. space or tab) or ' ' to specifically
# indicate a space. For example,
#
# -field_delim \s  
# -field_delim ' '
#
# Since the distinction between tabs and a space is usually not important, you
# can use \s with relative safety.
