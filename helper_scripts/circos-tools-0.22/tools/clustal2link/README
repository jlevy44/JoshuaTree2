Parse and visualize example data set

> ./run

which executes these two steps:

# generate data files
> bin/clustal2link -aln data/alignment.aln
# generate image ('circos' must be in your PATH)
> cd circos
> circos 

The circos/circos.conf configuration file requires that the files
created by clustal2link are placed in their default directory
(circos/).
